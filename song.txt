hello, it's me...
i was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
to go over everything

They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million milesx

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

contend that I worked on for so long, but I need to interrupt for now
added line
